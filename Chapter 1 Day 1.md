#Quest Chapter 1 Day 1

1. A blockchain is a decentralized digital public ledger. Broken down, that means the blockchain is a record of all transactions made on a specific network, no single entity has control over the blockchain, the blockchain exists solely in the digital realm, and anyone can view, make changes to, or store data on the blockchain at any time (it's an open and transparent network).

2. A Smart Contract is a program, or "rulebook," that a developer makes on a blockchain so that users can interact with it.

3. A transaction changes data on a blockchain and costs money, whereas scripts view data on a blockchain and are free.
