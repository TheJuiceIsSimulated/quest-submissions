## Quest Chapter 1 Day 2 âœ…

  **1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?**
  
  The five Cadence Programing Language Pillars are Safety and Security, Clarity, Approachability, Developer Experience, and Resource Oriented Programming.
  
  **2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?**
  
  Safety and Security is useful on Cadence because the more secure a Smart Contract is, it's really hard to be hack if a developer codes the Cadence contract well. The safer and more secure a Cadence Smart Contract is, the better it will be (developers would be able to read it easier, and because they can read it easier, they can understand what's being executed in the code and can more easily identify any bugs, which will help the user's experience/interaction with the smart contract).

  Clarity is useful on Cadence because its code is very eay to read compared to other languages (like Ethereum's Solidity), which is helpful. If a dev is ever minting NFTs or interacting with a DApp, the ability to read the smart contract code is really important so the dev knows that they're not going to be hacked/so the dev knows the contract isn't malicious in any other way. Clarity of the smart contract is also hugely helpful in ensuring that the code is human readable to prevent making any REALLY BAD AND PERMANENT coding errors.
  
  Approachability and Developer Experience are useful on Cadence because since Cadence is very easy to read in comparison to other programming languages, it's a great onboarding programming language for people to get into the Web3 space as developers. Cadence also offers approachability in that it offers a good coding environment for learning. (But LOL PlayGround reeeally needs to be fixed ASAP ðŸ˜‚)
