## Quest Chapter 2 Day 1 âœ…

**1. Deploy a contract to account `0x03` called "JacobTucker". Inside that contract, declare a constant variable named `is`, and make it have type `String`. Initialize it to "the best" when your contract gets deployed.**

```Cadence
pub contract JacobTucker {

    pub let is: String

    init() {
    self.is = "the best"
    }
}
```


**2. Check that your variable `is` actually equals "the best" by executing a script to read that variable. Include a screenshot of the output.**

```Cadence
import JacobTucker from 0x03

pub fun main (): String {
return JacobTucker.is
}
```
