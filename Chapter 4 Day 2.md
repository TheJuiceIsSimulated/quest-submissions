## Quest Chapter 4 Day 2

**1. What does `.link()` do?**

**2. In your own words (no code), explain how we can use resource interfaces to only expose certain things to the `/public/` path.**

**3. Deploy a contract that contains a resource that implements a resource interface. Then, do the following:**

  **i. In a transaction, save the resource to storage and link it to the public with the restrictive interface.**

  **ii. Run a script that tries to access a non-exposed field in the resource interface, and see the error pop up.**

  **iii. Run the script and access something you CAN read from. Return it from the script.**
