ASKED:

**What does calling a function mean?**

**What's the difference between `log` and `return`?**

Can `log` and `return` be used somewhat interchangeably in a script?


What does defining a function ourselves mean? What is the template to call a function? What does `.concat` mean? What do the curly brackets `{ }` mean? Why do functions have to be returned? Why is is bad to not specify what the type of the return value of a function is in `[access modifier] fun [function name] (parameter1: type, parameter2: type,...): [return type] {...}`? Do spaces in between lines of code matter, or are the spaces just helpful for making the code look nicer, easier to read, etc.?

What are parameters for?

What's the difference between putting something "inside" of a function vs. putting something in the function's parameters?


DIDN'T ASK YET:

Is there a list of all the Types in Cadence?

Why do we call the function in Line 3 before we define the function in Line 6? It would make better sense (to me, anyway) to define it before we call it.

In Chapter 1.5, you don't need to put `var` in the beginning of Lines 5 and 8 here?

In Chapter 2 Day 1, why is there an error if `self.greeting = "Hello, World!"` isn't in the `init` function? Why does it have to be in the `init` function?

In Chapter 2 Day 2, `pub fun changeGreeting(newGreeting: String)` doesn't follow the format of writing a function because it's missing the return type, is it because nothing is being returned in this function? If yes, why can't "Hello, World!" be returned under the `changeGreeting` function instead of being initialized in the `init` function? The code really isn't intuitive to me, I need help. Am I thinking to much into this?
